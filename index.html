									<p>
										In this paper, we investigated a theoretically proposed and widely observed
										"flow regime
										transition" as we simulated a curated sample of 8 planets ranging from hot
										Jupiters to
										the regime of ultra-hot Jupiters $\left( 1100~\mathrm{K}\leq T_{\mathrm{eq}}
										\leq
										2400~\mathrm{K}\right)$. The aforementioned flow transition is from a regime
										dominated
										by zonal jets, which is a common feature observed hot Jupiters, into a regime
										where the
										flow is dominated by day-to-night winds for the hotter planets. In order to
										facilitate
										this analysis, we
										developed a novel wavelet-based method and applied it to our sample of planets
										and
										dissected the simulated wind fields into time-dependent power spectra. This way
										we were
										able connect the flow transition to the disruption of the coupling between
										planetary-scale wave modes and smaller-scale eddy modes, a result of increasing
										stellar
										irradiation as we increase in equilibrium temperature.
									</p>

									<p>This is the first paper published as a part of my PhD studies and highlights my
										main
										areas of expertise: Working with general circulation models (GCMs) applied to
										gas giant
										atmospheres and developing analysis techniques to infer useful physics from
										simulations.</p>

									<p>In this paper, we focused on the coolest class of brown dwarfs, called Y
										dwarfs.
										While
										recent years have seen a surge of observations and modelling efforts focused
										on
										these
										objects, 3D circulation models of Y dwarfs
										are a largerly unexplored area of research.
										For this purpose we curated a sample of models spanning the parameter space
										of
										temperature
										ranges $400~\mathrm{K} \leq T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 600~\mathrm{K}$ and
										rotation rates
										$P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 2.5 ~\text{-} 20\, \mathrm{h}$, effectively covering
										possible Y
										dwarf configurations. Additionally, we included multiple salt
										($\mathrm{KCl},\,\mathrm{Na_{2}S}$) and sulfide ($\mathrm{MnS}$) species in
										our
										simulations to probe the interplay of rotation, convection and cloud thermal
										feedback
										effects. The resulting Y dwarf atmospheres are weakly dynamic and less
										variable than
										observations, resulting in our conclusion that the physical mechanisms
										behind their
										observed
										variability remains unknown.</p>

									<p>This paper is my second first-author paper and also the final paper of my
										PhD. A
										result
										of my growing interest into performing 3D simulations brown dwarf
										atmospheres, it resulted in the development of many new physics modules for
										our
										in-house
										GCM THOR. The modifications can be found on my private GitHub repository
										linked

									<p>In this paper, we report the detection of sodium and refractory metals in an
										evoporating
										tail of the ultra-hot Jupiter Kelt-9b. Combining four different datasets of
										optical
										transit observations and performing a cross-correlation analysis of our datasets
										reveals
										a distinct and robust absorption signal clearly separated from the planetary
										signal,
										which we interpret as consistent with an evaporative tail. We go through the
										different
										components in the measured signals, discuss possible alternative explanations
										and
										develop a simplified model to retrieve the physical properties of the tail. The
										result
										is, to our knowledge the first detection of an evaporating tail in the optical
										wavelength regime and the retrieved physical parameters are consistent with
										literature
										values.

										between
										Leo and I, whereas the analysis of the data and the retrievals were performed by
										Nic Borsato.
